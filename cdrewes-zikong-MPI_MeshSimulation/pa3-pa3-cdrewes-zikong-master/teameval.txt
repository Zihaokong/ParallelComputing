               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they

If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Colin Drewes 

 
B: Zihao Kong

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B 
meetings 	  	  	1              1
