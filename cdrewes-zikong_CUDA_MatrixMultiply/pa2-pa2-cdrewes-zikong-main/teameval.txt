		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Zihao Kong

 
B: Colin Drewes

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	        B
meetings			2 		2
coding 	  	  	 	8		25
writeup 	  	  	4		4
planning (alone) 	  	2 	 	4
total (including meetings) 	16		35


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
  	A: Partner A implemented the basic tiled matrix multiplication in the beginning, and Zihao was collecting data for final report as writing on report as well.
  	B: Partner B optimimized the basic tiled matrix multiplication to get us to our final performance goals. Also helped partner A with writeup.

  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
  	A,B: We completed the project.

  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how your team worked together;
  	A,B: We are good independent workers and were able to make a lot of progress ourselves which made our group work more efficient. However, it would have benefited us to start earlier so we could spend more time on the writeup.

  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
  	A,B: Begin on the project earlier. Spend more time on the theory before jumping into coding.

  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
  	A,B: Start the project earlier, communicate more frequently. 

  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
  	A,B: None
